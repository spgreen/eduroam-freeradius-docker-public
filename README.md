README Author: Simon Green


Docker image which allows the user to create a FreeRADIUS server with bare minimum eduroam presets, within a Docker container.

Based off GÃ‰ANT's technical documentation found [here](https://wiki.geant.org/display/H2eduroam/How+to+deploy+eduroam+on-site+or+on+campus#Howtodeployeduroamon-siteoroncampus-FreeRADIUS).

Based off lrhazi's freeradius-eduroam docker setup found [here](https://github.com/lrhazi/freeradius-eduroam ).

#####Note:

* The following symbol "$" indicates code to be run inside the terminal 
* The following symbol ">#" indicates code to be run inside the terminal as a super user (sudo 'command', su, sudo -s)
* The hashtag symbols "#" are comment lines with useful information


#####Files have been edited to follow GÃ‰ANT's Technical documentation for eduroam Identity Providers (IdPs)

#####Script files: 

    build_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh          # rebuilds freeradius-eduroam Docker image files. Edit configuration 
		    							# files first in /files/etc/raddb/* for your eduroam IdP configuration
			    						# before building the image
    
    restart_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh        # starts/restarts the docker container. 
    									# IMPORTANT: Add the necessary config for your eduroam IdP
    
    access_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh         # enter into container and test out configuration. It is suggested to open two 
    									# terminals to view /var/log/freeradius/radius.log for debugging and the 
    									# other for testing accounts


####Pre-Requisites:

* [Mac Installation & Quickstart Guide](https://docs.docker.com/mac/)

* [Other OS Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/installation/)
	
                   
###Setting Up and Running your eduroam IdP FreeRADIUS Server:

####Initial Setup:
    	
1) Pull the spgreen/freeradius-eduroam Docker image from docker hub:
	    
		># docker pull spgreen/freeradius-eduroam


2) Git clone the package to your system. Ensure git is installed on your system.
	
    	$ git clone https://github.com/spgreen/eduroam-freeradius-docker
	    
3) Enter into the cloned directory

		$ cd eduroam-freeradius-docker
		
####Configuration:
    
4) Configure variables in restart_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh then save and exit

    	#Edit the following varibles to provide the necessary configuration for your eduroam IdP 
    	#in restart_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh:
        
        NO_OF_FLR_SERVERS=1				#Select number of FLR servers in your eduroam setup (between 1 to 2)    
    	EDUROAM_FLR1=192.168.100.102
    	EDUROAM_FLR2=192.168.100.110	#A random IP is still needed for only 1 FLR; otherwise it will not start 
    	FLR_EDUROAM_SECRET=supertest
    	YOUR_REALM=docker.sg
    	YOUR_PASSWORD=docker123
    	ENVIRONMENT=TEST 				#Select from either TEST or PRODUCTION  

Notes:  It links with the './files/environment/root/run.sh' script to:
* configure your eduroam FLR servers with their corresponding secrets and your eduroam realm settings (yourdomain.tld) in /etc/raddb/proxy.conf
* configure your eduroam FLR servers with their secrets in /etc/raddb/clients.conf
* configure the testuser's realm and password in /etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authrorize 
* configures between TEST or PRODUCTION environment. TEST gives more debug logging information found in /var/log/freeradius/radius.log
                              
####Running:

5) Run restart_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh:

		># ./restart_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh

6)  You will receive two errors if this is your first time starting the container as the freeradius-eduroam container currently does not exist. A hexadecimal output will be displayed if the container has started correctly
            
		> 14c1813807d1de325de56987a8765b61f8b9e94422748349ab48aaab9976ef79

Now your FreeRADIUS eduroam IdP Docker container is running in the background
        

####Accessing the Container:
    
7) To access the container, run the access_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh script:

		># ./access_eduroamFreeRADIUS.sh
        
        
####Testing Authentication:

#####Docker testuser:

8) Use the test.sh script whilst inside the container with the username and password following the command. e.g.
           
######Username for the test user:

		testuser@YOUR_REALM 

  where YOUR_REALM is the variable that you assigned in Step 3.  
  
             
             
######Password: 

		TEST_PASSWORD

where TEST_PASSWORD is the variable that you assigned in Step 3  


######FLR Server: 
Enter the number 1 or 2 to indicate which FLR server you wish to send the request to.

		1 = EDUROAM_FLR1
		2 = EDUROAM_FLR2
           
From the variables given in Step 3 and choosing EDUROAM_FLR1, the following test.sh command will be:
                
		># ./test.sh testuser@docker.sg docker123 1
    
    
Execute the command. You will then receive either of these two messages:

	"SUCCESS" - the user has successfully authenticated 
	
	"FAILIURE" - the user has failed authentication. Possible issues:

        	a. Mistyped user credentials
        	b. User does not exist
        	c. FLR Server active but not configured correctly
        	d. FLR Server offline     

Note: test.sh is using eapol_test to test the eap authentication between the FLR and the Docker eduroam IdP. If you want to see a more in-depth view of the authentication process, view the log file located here (**only in TEST environment**):
                   
	/var/log/freeradius/radius.log
                        
The log will give you a good idea if something has gone wrong

                  
#####Other Users within eduroam:

9) Follow the same process as in Step 9 but using a different username and password.
The username and password must belong to an account that exists within your country's eduroam network.
                       
If both tests succeed, then your eduroam IdP FreeRADIUS is working correctly.
        
               
####Exiting from the Docker FreeRADIUS Container:
    
10) To exit out of the container, use the following command:
        
		># exit

Note: The container will still be running in the background
            
            
####Manually Start/Stop your new FreeRADIUS eduroam IdP Container:
         
11) Stop:
	
		># docker stop freeradius-eduroam
        
12) Start:
   
   		># docker start freeradius-eduroam
